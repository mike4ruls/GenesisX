===Version 1.0===3/1/17
-The start of an Open GL engine
-Created Window

===Version 1.1===3/1/17
-Draws vertices to the screen

===Version 2.0===3/1/17
-Added new clases:
 ~ Camera.h
 ~ Engine.h
 ~ Game.h
 ~ GameEntity.h
 ~ Mesh.h
 ~ Object.h
 ~ Renderer.h
 ~ Timer.h
 ~ Vertex.h
-Moved vertices to a Mesh class that is held by the Game Entity class
-Added a Vertex class that holds a struct of how the data of my vertices will be arranged
-Added in-game timer, delta time, and etc
-Added necessary methods for transformations, scale, and rotation inside Game Enity class
(NOTE: Can't implement them though because I don't know how to use openGL's math library ;-;
Also I need to get my vertex and pixel shader up and running before I can even use them anyways)

===Version 2.5===3/5/17
-Added dynamic rendering for my game objects
(Basically they automatically add them selves to the render to be rendered on their own)

===Version 3.0===3/13/17
-Moved Basic window creation and game loop to the engine class
-Added Shader Manager Class
-Finally got Verter Shader and Pixel Shader implemented and working

===Version 3.3===3/15/17
-Modified the vertex shader to accept a struct of vertex information coming in
-Added more information to my vertex (uv's, normals, color)
-Added mouse and keyboard input

===Version 4.0=== 3/22/17
-Added movable camera that moves and rotates
-Added input to move up, down, left, right, foward, backward
-Added sprinting with LEFT SHIFT
-Added 3-D cube mesh to view in the engine
-Added cycling colors that change over time

===Version 4.3=== 3/24/17
-Added model loading
-Added teapot model obj to engine
-Added my own hand made model of the ray gun

===Version 4.6=== 3/26/17
-Finally got textures to work on game objects
-Moved texturing loading to mesh class
-Shaders can sort between objects that have textures and no textures
-Fixed Scaling bug not working right

===Version 4.9=== 3/26/17
-Added lights to game engine
-Added a light class
	~light class automatically creates a gameobject sphere at the light source position
	to visually see where the light source is at
	~light tags the game object as "light"
	~In renderer, i can sort through tags to find light sources and turn on line only rendering
	then turn it off when it is not needed anymore
-Revamped my vertex and pixel/fragment shader to output and input structs of information between the shaders
-Added Ambience
-Added Specular
=Bugs=
-Lighting isn't fully working, it doing something but not what I want. It almost looks correct
but i'm pretty sure its how i'm calculating the normals

===Version 4.99=== 3/26/17
-Restructed Game Objects to have Transform structs
-Added Ridgid Body structs to Game Objects that hold:
	~Velocity, Acceleration, Friction, and Mass
-Added methods to apply forces to the Game Object and move it accordingly taking in account friction
-Added a method that applys a gravity force on Game Objects
-Added button controls to switch on and off gravity force and applying a force to the ray gun object
	~(G) turns on and off gravity
	~(N) applies a force to the ray gun object in the positive x direction
=Bugs=
-Lighting still don't work right ;-;

===Version 5.0=== 3/29/17
-FINALLY GOT LIGHTS WORKING
	~Apperently my normals weren't getting loaded in right
	~Had to re-write my code to take in indices for positions, uv's, and normals
-Fixed fragment shader to display lighting correctly
-Lights and game objects now have a radius based on the farthest vertice from it's origin
-Using the lights radius I can now calculate if a vertice is in range of the light source so it can be rendered
-The distance an object is away from the light source effects the light intensity on the object, it fades in and 
out pretty well
-Meshes now hold specular data
-Light sources now hold ambience data
-Added InputManager Class, moved all input code to approprate spots
-Left, Right, Up, and Down keys move the ray gun model left, right, foward, and backwards using forces

===Version 5.1=== 3/31/17
-Ok NOW I actually fixed lights in the engine(normal calculations were messed up)
-Can now swap between different ambiences of light

===Version 5.5=== 4/11/17
-Added SkyBoxes 
-Added TONS of Skyboxes
-Can swap between Sky Boxes at will with TAB
-Optimized, draws the Sky Box last after everything else is done rendering

===Version 5.7=== 4/21/17
-Added object parenting, child moves with parent object
-Fixed Lighting calculations
-Changed light values
-Getting ready to implement Deffered Rendering

===Version 5.9=== 4/24/17
-First implementation of deferred rendering
-Added new shaders to handle deffered rendering
-Added new render target called g_Buffer that holds:
	~The color texture
	~The normal texture
	~The frag position texture
-Fixed sky box rendering with deferred rendering, still gets rendered at the end
=Bugs=
-Having a hard time go about lighting certain pixels if they are being hit by a light
-As of now it only outputs regular textures with no lighting

===Version 6.0=== 5/03/17
-FINALLY DONE WITH THIS SHIT
-Deferred rendering implemented
-Code is pretty shitty right now, need to clean up
-g_Buffer holds:
	~The color texture
	~The normal texture
	~The frag position texture
	~The final texture
-Almost used a stencil buffer, developed my own approach
-Modified Shaders to handle different graphics cards and not break

===Version 6.5=== 5/04/17
-Restructed my engine so that information isn't all over the place
-Added lists of lights to render in the Renderer class
-Lights now push themselves to the light list in the Renderer class on their own
-Added a move method to lights
-Added functionality to render lights sphere radius at will
-Added multiples lights to the scene for testing(it works :D)
-Added a default wall model to test lighting
-Moving lights in a circle like motion, testing the Move function (that also works :DD)
-Cleaned up code and now ready to move foward

===Version 7.0=== 5/05/17
-Improved obj model loading
-Can now loading in objects with multiple meshes
-Can now load mtl files and use them properly
-restructured renderer to render multiple meshes in an object
